## Why you'll like it

- **It's yours.** Point it at a folder and it just works — offline, forever. Nothing is uploaded anywhere.
- **It's quick.** Thousands of tracks scroll without a stutter — the list is virtualized and every cover is cached to disk after the first scan.
- **It looks good.** Nine themes, any accent color you like, your own wallpaper behind the interface.
- **It fills the gaps.** Missing a track? Search YouTube, paste a Spotify playlist, or grab what's charting today — without leaving the app.
- **It respects you.** Your listening stats are computed on your device and never leave it.

## See it in action

### Charts by country *and* genre

Browse what's trending worldwide or dive into a genre — Pop, Hip-hop, Phonk, Metal, K-pop and more. One click downloads the track, tags and cover art included.

### Your year in music, computed locally

Listening time, top artists and tracks, a streak counter, and a clock showing when you actually listen. Day, month, year or all-time — none of it ever leaves your machine.

### Nine themes, one click

Dark, Light, System, plus six hand-tuned palettes: Nocturne, Terracotta, Forest, Vapor, Crimson Noir and Arctic. Pick any accent color to go with them.

### A player worth going fullscreen for

Real waveform seeking, an upcoming-queue panel, and a portrait "mobile player" mode for when the window is narrow.

## 📦 Download

Grab the latest build from the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/MishaSok/audex-player/releases/latest):

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| **Linux** | `Audex-1.2.0.AppImage` (portable) or `audex-player_1.2.0_amd64.deb` |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | `Audex-1.2.0-arm64.dmg` |
| **Windows** | `Audex.Setup.1.2.0.exe` |

**Nothing else to install.** `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg` and Chromium all ship inside the app — downloading and parsing work out of the box.

> **Builds are unsigned**, so the OS will ask once:
> - **macOS** — right-click the app → **Open**, or run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Audex.app`.
> - **Windows** — SmartScreen may warn; click **More info → Run anyway**.

## 🛠️ Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MishaSok/audex-player.git
cd audex-player
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` runs `electron . --no-sandbox` (the flag avoids sandbox permission issues on some Linux setups).

```bash
npm run dist   # Linux AppImage + .deb into release/
```

macOS and Windows builds are produced by GitHub Actions on tag push.
